\details{
\itemize{
  \item \strong{Purpose:} The primary goal of \pkg{SimpleEnsembleGroup17} is to offer users a versatile toolkit for building robust predictive models, particularly in scenarios where the number of predictors is significantly larger than the sample size. Whether you're performing linear regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, elastic net, random forest, logistic regression or ensemble learning, this package provides the necessary tools to streamline your analysis.

  \item \strong{Main Features:}
    \item \emph{Linear and Logistic Regression:} Fit regression models to your data with ease, supporting both binary and continuous response variables.
    \item \emph{Regularization Techniques:} Utilize ridge regression, lasso regression, and elastic net regularization to handle multicollinearity and perform feature selection.
    \item \emph{Model Robustness:} Enhance the robustness of your models with techniques like bagging, which averages predictions from multiple models trained on bootstrap samples.
    \item \emph{Ensemble Learning:} Combine the strengths of different models using ensemble learning techniques to improve prediction accuracy and generalization performance.

  \item \strong{How Users Benefit:} By leveraging the capabilities of \pkg{SimpleEnsembleGroup17}, users can:
    \item Efficiently build predictive models for a wide range of datasets, including those with a large number of predictors.
    \item Perform feature selection and regularization to improve model interpretability and generalization performance.
    \item Enhance model robustness and predictions through techniques like bagging and ensemble learning.

  \item \strong{Getting Started:} To get started with \pkg{SimpleEnsembleGroup17}, install the package using the following command:
  \code{install.packages("SimpleEnsembleGroup17")}
