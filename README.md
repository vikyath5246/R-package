## Things to be done

- Write down all the pointers

# Package Creation

- Models (Linear, Logistic, Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net, SVM, Random Forest, Boosted Trees)
- Top K most informative predictors (Using AIC, BIC, VIF etc)
- Bagging with sampling with replacement for sample R times
- Returning a Naive variable importance score (Which counts the number of times each variable is selected)
- Ensemble learning

## Later Segregate these into proper pointers

- Need to write warnings also
